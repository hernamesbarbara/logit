 ##Logit Regression

* Used to model dichotomous outcomes
* Logistic regression invovles modeling the log odds of the outcome as a linear combination of the predictor variables

Example 1
* What are the factors that influence whether a political candidate wins an election?
* Target variable is binary (True/False) for a Win or a Loss
* Predictor variables might include:
	* Campaign budget in dollars
	* Whether [attack ads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_ad "In politics, attack ads are ads whose message is meant as a personal attack against another candidate. From Wikipedia") were invovled in the campaign strategy
	* Whether or not the candidate is an incumbent

Example 2
* What are the factors that influence admission into graduate school?
* Target variable is binary (True/False) for Admitted or Not Admitted
* Predictor variables might include:
	* Graduate Record Exam scores
	* Grade Point Average (GPA)
	* Prestige of the undergraduate institution
